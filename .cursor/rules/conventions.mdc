## Raw Markdown Format Instructions

When I ask for you to respond in "raw markdown", I want the markdown content wrapped in a code block for easy copy-pasting:

**Key requirements:**

1. Wrap the entire markdown in ```md and ```.
2. Replace any triple backticks (```) inside the markdown with tildes (~~~) to avoid conflicts.
3. Don't escape or modify the markdown syntax - keep it as valid markdown.
4. I want to copy-paste the entire block including the wrapper

**Example of what I don't want:**
# My Title
## Subtitle
```ts
const code = "example";
```
Regular markdown text here.

**Example of what I want:**

```md
# My Title
## Subtitle
~~~ts
const code = "example";
~~~
Regular markdown text here.
```

## Important

- Be honest and if you aren’t sure, it's better to say "I don't know" than guess, halt the
  conversation immediately.
- When asked for a change, if you are incapable of doing, or lacking access etc., halt the
  conversation immediately and let me know what the issue is.
- If you don't have enough context to give a confident answer, halt the conversation immediately and
  let me know what additional information you need.
- Don't leave comments without a period or any other punctuation mark in the end.
- Do not remove existing code or comments unless specifically asked to do so.

## General

- If asked for code examples or code changes or edits, don't provide explanation unless specifically
  asked for it. Directly provide the code.
- If you add a comment for backward compatibility, or some action you took based on user request, make it a TODO comment.
- Use a modular structure for projects, breaking down components and utilities into separate files
  and folders. Don't create large files unless asked for.
- Use a consistent naming convention for files and folders.
- When refactoring or asking for code changes, do not remove existing code unless specifically asked
  to do so. Instead, add new code or modify existing code as needed. Leave the comments in the code
  unless specifically asked to remove them, only update if necessary or delete if the comment is not
  relevant anymore.
- When fixing an error, don’t just do backward compatible, ask to see if we can fix it.

## Typescript

- Use `unknown` over `any` for unknown types.
- Avoid using `any` at all costs unless absolutely necessary. Better check with me first if you need to use it.
- Don't type the return types of functions unless it cannot be inferred or it needs to be casted,
  which should be done at the end of the function.
- If returning object / array, return `as const`.

## How to write code

- Export directly unless it's a component file, then follow the structure below.
- Arrow functions should be used for all function expressions.
- Explicit return types should be used for all functions unless it can fit in a single line. e.g.:
  - if (falseCondition) return;
  - const mappedValues = values.map((value) => value \* 2);
- Only default import `React` and always used `React.<anything>`. Don't do named import for react functions.
- Always make sure sentences end with a period or any other punctuation mark in comments.
  - This can also apply to strings where it makes sense.

### Linting

- Use ESLint and Prettier for linting and formatting.
- Leave empty lines at the end of files.
- Single line returns can be inlined, can avoid braces and return keyword.
- If multiple lines, always use explicit return.
- Max char per line is 80.
- Prefer empty line before return statements unless it's a single return statement in a function.

### How to write comments

- Do not use we, I, you, etc.
- Start with a verb and use present tense on a third person. e.g.:
  - "Performs a calculation."
  - "Adds a new user to the database."
  - "Fetches data from the API."
- The first line / paragraph should be a short summary of the function.
- Details, notes and usage description should be in the next paragraph(s).
- Don't add comments to obvious code. Prefer better names over comments. Comments should only be
  used to explain complex logic or provide additional context.
- Use `//` for single line comments.
- Use `/** */` for multi-line comments.
- Use `/** */` for the constant if we are describing a constant.
- Use `@example` for examples.
- Use `@component` for React components.
- Use `@see` for references to other functions or components.

## Folder structure

```bash
/components   # Contains utility components. e.g. TooltipButton
/containers   # Contains components that contain other components or are used to group components together. e.g. SchedulerDashboard
/hooks        # Contains custom utility hooks. e.g. usePagination
/providers    # Contains context providers. e.g. UserProvider
/utils        # Contains utility functions. e.g. formatDate
/types        # Contains TypeScript type definitions.
/app          # Contains the main nextjs app structure. e.g. pages, layouts, etc.
```

### When creating a component, use the following structure

```bash
# Required:
/ComponentName/
/ComponentName/index.ts
/ComponentName/ComponentName.tsx

# Optional:
/ComponentName/constants.ts
/ComponentName/utils.ts
/ComponentName/hooks.ts
/ComponentName/types.ts
```

### `index.ts` structure

```tsx
// # Required:
export { default } from "./ComponentName";
export * from "./ComponentName";

// # Optional:
// If we have constants or types that the consumers may need to import, we can export them here as well.
// export * from "./constants";
// or if we only need to export a few constants or types, we can export them individually. Generally prefer exporting everything.
// export { SOME_CONSTANT, SomeEnum } from "./constants";
// export * from "./types";
```

### `ComponentName.tsx` structure

```tsx
import React from "react";

// Optional:
// If we need styles. Don't use css modules, use regular styles.
// import styles from "./styles";

// Prefer using `IProps` for interface names.
interface IProps {
  // Props here.
}

// Prefer using `React.FC` for functional components.
// If with children, use React.FCWithChildren (this exists internally).
// Describe the component and its purpose in the comment above the component.
// Prefer using PascalCase for component names.
/**
 * Performs some component functionality.
 *
 * @component
 * ```
 */
const ComponentName: React.FC<IProps> = ({ /* props */ }) => {
  // NOTE: Props should be destructured in the function signature unless:
  // - We need to pass or spread props. Which in this case can be partially destructured depending on the use case.
  // - We need to use the props in a different way. In this case, we can destructure them inside the function.
  // Component logic here.
  // If the logic is complex, or reusable or if we need to use it in multiple components, we can create a custom hook or utility and move it to the appropriate file.
  // Try to keep the component logic as simple as possible.

  return (
    // JSX here.
    // If the component is complex, we can break it down into smaller components and move them to a separate file.
  );
};

export type { IProps as ComponentNameProps };
export default ComponentName;

```

### `constants.ts` structure

```tsx
// Constants here.
// Prefer UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants.
export const SOME_CONSTANT = "SOME_CONSTANT";

// Enums here.
// Prefer `as const` for enum-like objects over `enum`.
// Enum keys should be in PascalCase and values should match the keys unless specified otherwise.
export const SomeEnum = {
  SomeValueA: "SomeValueA",
  SomeValueB: "SomeValueB",
} as const;
```

### `utils.ts` structure

```ts
// Utility functions here.
// Prefer using arrow functions and explicit return types.
// Use descriptive names for utility functions.
// Always add a good description for the utility function with some examples if possible, at least a few.
// If the parameters are obvious, don't need to describe them. Prefer better names over comments.
/**
 * Performs some utility function.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * exampleFunction("example"); // returns "example"
 * exampleFunction("another"); // returns "another"
 * ```
 */
export const exampleFunction = (param: string) => {
  // Utility logic here.

  return param;
};
// If the utility function is complex, we can break it down into smaller functions, and anything reusable in the app should be moved to a root utils folder.
```

### `hooks.ts` structure

```tsx
// Custom hooks here.
// Use descriptive names for custom hooks.
// Always return hook object and array values `as const`.
// Always add a good description for the custom hook. If complex, can add examples as well.
/**
 * Performs some custom hook functionality.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * const { value, setValue } = useCustomHook();
 * ```
 */
export const useCustomHook = () => {
  // Hook logic here.

  return {
    /* return values */
  } as const;
};
```

### `types.ts` structure

```ts
// Types here.
// Prefer using `interface` over `type` for defining object types.
// Use descriptive names for types.
// Use PascalCase for type names.
// Use `type` for union types or other complex types.
// If possible, use generics to make the types more flexible.
// Mapped types are great for creating types based on existing types, if possible, use them.
// Prefer using `Record<string, unknown>` for object types with unknown keys or have it as generic.
export interface SomeDefinition {
  // Props here.
  // Ensure to add descriptive names for the properties.
  // Comments should be used to describe the properties if not obvious.
  propertyName: string;
  /**
   * Description of the property.
   *
   * Can be multi-line if needed.
   */
  anotherProperty: number;
}

// Use `type` for union types or other complex types.
export type SomeType = string | number | boolean;
// Use `type` for mapped types.
export type MappedType<T> = {
  [K in keyof T]: T[K];
};
// Use `type` for generic types.
export type GenericType<T> = {
  [key: string]: T;
};
// Use `type` for function types.
export type FunctionType = (param: string) => number;
```
